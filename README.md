This repository provides a step-by-step guide on deploying an end-to-end Machine Learning (ML) project in a production environment on the AWS Cloud. The deployment process is automated using a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline, and the code is deployed on an EC2 instance using GitHub Actions.

## Overview

In this project, we aim to deploy a complete ML solution in a scalable and automated way on AWS. The project includes the following key components:

1. ML Model: Develop and train the ML model using the appropriate libraries and frameworks (e.g. scikit-learn).

2. Data Preprocessing: Implement data preprocessing steps to clean and transform raw data for the ML model.

3. AWS Cloud Setup: Configure AWS resources such as EC2 instance and IAM roles for deployment.

4. CI/CD Pipeline: Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate the deployment process.

5. Deployment on EC2: Deploy the ML model on an EC2 instance to handle incoming requests.

## Deployment Steps

1. Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local development environment.

2. Train and Test the ML Model: Develop and test the ML model on your local machine. Make sure the model meets the desired performance metrics.

3. Data Preprocessing: Implement data preprocessing scripts to clean and prepare the data for deployment.

4. AWS Cloud Setup: Create an AWS account if you don't have one already. Set up an EC2 instance with the necessary configurations and define IAM roles for proper permissions.

5. Configure AWS Credentials: Set up AWS credentials on your local machine and securely store them for GitHub Actions to use during the deployment process.

6. CI/CD Pipeline: Define the CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. This pipeline will trigger automatic deployments whenever code changes are pushed to the main branch.

7. Deploy on EC2: Implement the necessary scripts and configurations to deploy the ML model on the EC2 instance using GitHub Actions.

## Getting Started

To get started with deploying the ML project on AWS Cloud, follow these steps:

1. Install Dependencies: Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed, such as Python, AWS CLI, and other required libraries.

2. Clone this Repository: Use the following command to clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/NitishKundu/aws-deployment.git
```

3. Set Up AWS Account: Create an AWS account and configure the AWS CLI on your local machine.

4. Train the Model: Develop and train your ML model on your local machine. Save the trained model and other artifacts to the appropriate directories in this repository.

5. Configure CI/CD Pipeline: Modify the `.github/workflows/main.yml` file to suit your project requirements and set up the necessary environment variables for AWS credentials.

6. Test the Pipeline: Push changes to the main branch and verify that the CI/CD pipeline triggers the deployment process successfully.

7. Monitor the Deployment: Monitor the EC2 instance and other AWS resources to ensure the ML model is functioning correctly in the production environment.

## Notes

- Keep your AWS credentials and sensitive information secure and avoid pushing them to the repository.

- Regularly update the dependencies and monitor security vulnerabilities to maintain a robust and secure deployment.

- Feel free to customize the project to suit your specific ML model and deployment needs.
